### Background
---

***As a group we embarked on a journey to utilize the knowledge gathered from the last six months and apply our understanding of the Fintech industry, it's implications and applications on the world's financial sector. In this project, we will be partaking in a deep dive of what's to come from crytography, smart contracts, decentralize finance, blockchain and crytocurrencies. We are all apprehensive of our knowledge of the Fintech industry, it's growth from the late 1990s, and it's presence in all walks of life. This has proven to be an exciting endeavour and we do hope that enthusiasm will be shown.***
