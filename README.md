### Background
---

***As a group we embarked on a journey to utilize the knowledge gathered of the last six months and apply our understanding of the Fintech industry, it's implications and applications on the world's financial sector. In this project, we will be partaking in a deep dive of what's to come from crytography, smart contracts, decentralize finance, blockchain and crytocurrencies. We are all apprehensive of our knowledge of the Fintech industry, it's growth from the late 1990s, and it's presence in all walks of life. This has proven to be an exciting endeavour and we do hope that enthusiasm shown through.***

Digital disruption is changing what we do, and how we get things done, in countless ways. What does this have to do with the future of Finance? In short Everything! Here's the future we see. The eight predictions about digital transformation in Finance:

- The finance Factory-

   Transactions will be touchless as automation and blockchain reach deeper into finance operations.
   

- The role of Finance-

   With Operations largely automated, Finance will double down on business insights and service. Success is not assured.
   
     
- Finance Cycles-

   Finance goes real time. Periodic reporting will no longer drive operations and decisions, if it ever did.
   
   
- Sel-service-

   Self-service will become the norm. Finance will be uneasy about this.
   
   
- Operating Models-

   New service-delivery models will emerge as robots and algorithms join a more diverse finance workforce, think about the integration of freelancers, gig workers, and crowds.
   
   
- Enterprise resource planning-

   Finance applications and microservices challenge traditional ERP. Big venders will be prepared.
   
   
- Data-

   The proliferation of APIs will drive data standardization, but it won't be enough. Companies will still be struggling to clean up their data messes.
   
   
- Workforce and workplace-


   Employees will be doing new things in new ways, some of which will make CFOs uncomfortable.
